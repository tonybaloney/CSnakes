/****
 * Design notes
 * The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is a mutex in Python that makes Python thread-safe.
 * The mutex is associated with a "thread state" object, which is an internal data structure in CPython.
 * The pointer to the thread state is stored in the current thread's TLS (Thread Local Storage).
 *
 * Since .NET freely uses threads, we need to ensure that the GIL is acquired before calling any Python API.
 * Also, this class is designed to be reentrant, so that the GIL can be acquired multiple times by the same thread.
 *
 * The "PyGilState" class is a disposable object that acquires the GIL when it is created and releases it when it is disposed.
 *
 * IF a PyObject is allocated and then left for the GC to dispose, since the GC in .NET runs in a thread-pool,
 * this can lead to some performance challenges where the GC taking and switching the GIL and the user code is also trying to acquire the GIL.
 *
 * Some potential improvements -
 *   - Consider saving the Python Thread State pointer in TLS and use the PyEval_SaveThread and PyEval_RestoreThread functions to save and restore the thread state.
 *   - Consider queuing the Dispose of PyObject/SafeHandles so they can be processed in collections, rather than switching the GIL in the finalizer thread. I don't know if the GC Finalizer spawns a thread per object or a thread pool?
