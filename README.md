CSnakes is a .NET Source Generator and Runtime that you can use to embed **Python** code and libraries into your **C#.NET Solution** at a performant, low-level without the need for REST, HTTP, or Microservices.

Check out the [getting started](https://tonybaloney.github.io/CSnakes/latest/getting-started/quick-start/) guide or check out the [demo solution](https://github.com/tonybaloney/CSnakes/tree/main/samples) to see more.

## Features

- ü§ñ Supports .NET 8 and 9  
- üêç Supports Python 3.9-3.13  
- üì¶ [Supports Virtual Environments and C-Extensions](https://tonybaloney.github.io/CSnakes/latest/user-guide/environments/)  
- üíª Supports Windows, macOS, and Linux  
- üßÆ [Tight integration between NumPy ndarrays and Spans, 2D Spans and TensorSpans (.NET 9)](https://tonybaloney.github.io/CSnakes/latest/user-guide/buffers/)  
- ‚ö° Uses Python's C-API for fast invocation of Python code directly in the .NET process  
- üß† Uses Python type hinting to generate function signatures with .NET native types  
- üßµ Supports [CPython 3.13 "free-threading" mode](https://tonybaloney.github.io/CSnakes/latest/advanced/free-threading/)  
- üß© Supports nested sequence and mapping types (`tuple`, `dict`, `list`)  
- üè∑Ô∏è Supports default values  
- üî• Supports [Hot Reload](https://tonybaloney.github.io/CSnakes/latest/advanced/hot-reload/) of Python code in Visual Studio and supported IDEs  
- üöÄ Supports [UV](https://tonybaloney.github.io/CSnakes/latest/user-guide/environments/#installing-dependencies-with-uv) for fast installation of Python packages and dependencies  

## Benefits

- Uses native Python type hinting standards to produce clean, readable C# code with minimal boiler plate!
- Integration between .NET and Python is done at the C-API, meaning strong compatibility between Python versions 3.8-3.13 and .NET 8-9.
- Integration is low-level and high-performance.
- CSnakes uses the CPython C-API and is compatible with all Python extensions.
- Invocation of Python code and libraries is in the same process as .NET

## Example

CSnakes will generate a C#.NET class for any Python file in a project that is tagged as CSharp Analyzer Additional File (see [Getting Started](https://tonybaloney.github.io/CSnakes/latest/getting-started/quick-start/)).
All functions in that class with type annotations will be reflected to callable C# methods and an environment builder added to that module.

Given the following Python file called `example.py`

```python

def hello_world(name: str, age: int) -> str:
  return f"Hello {name}, you must be {age} years old!"
```

CSnakes will generate a static .NET class called `Example` with the function:

```csharp
public class Example {
  public static string HelloWorld(string name, long age) {
    ...
  }
}
```

When called, `HelloWorld()` will invoke the Python function from `example.py` using Python's C-API and return native .NET types.
